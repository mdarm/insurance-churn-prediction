# Insurance Churn Prediction

## Description
This project focuses on predicting customer churn within the insurance industry, specifically for car insurance contracts. The predicted churn rates for insurance contracts are set to expire within a horizon of two months, with a particular focus on balancing the identification of false churners and false non-churners. The goal is to enable targeted interventions that enhance customer retention and optimize the balance between customer retention efforts and resource allocation.

## Challenge outcome
Enhance an insurance company's ability to predict churn, thereby increasing its profitability and competitive edge through effective churn management.

## Benchmark
A model from Oracle's analytics team, was previously implemented in a large insurance company in Greece, achieving an approximate accuracy of 72% - allegedly.

## Objective
- Build a (machine learning) model that predicts customer churn for car insurance contracts.
- Identify and analyse the risk factors contributing to customer churn.
- Apply the model to current customers for conducting targeted retention campaigns.

## Potential benefits
- Improved prediction of customer churn.
- Increased profitability through effective churn management.
- Enhanced competitiveness in the insurance industry.
