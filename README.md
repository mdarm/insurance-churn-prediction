# Insurance Churn Prediction

## Description

## Challenge outcome

## Benchmark
A model from Oracle's analytics team, was previously implemented in a large insurance company in Greece, achieving an approximate accuracy of 72% - allegedly.

## Objective
- Build a (machine learning) model that predicts customer churn for car insurance contracts.
- Identify and analyse the risk factors contributing to customer churn.
- Apply the model to current customers for conducting targeted retention campaigns.

## Potential benefits
- Improved prediction of customer churn.
- Increased profitability through effective churn management.
- Enhanced competitiveness in the insurance industry.
